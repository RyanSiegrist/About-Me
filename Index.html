        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>
            I have been working at Ford Motor Credit for over 20 years.  
            I started my Ford Credit career as a file clerk and worked my up to my current position <em>"Sr. Performance Analyst"</em>.  
            In my current position I create spreadsheets through excel and utilize formulas to present raw data in an understandable format.  
            While doing this I found that I really enjoyed creating complex formulas that made my spreadsheets more efficient.  
            This has led to my interest in coding and software development.  
            My first real exposure to HTML/CSS/JavaScript has been over the last five weeks working with the <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a> courses.
         <br></br>
            I am excited about the possibility to become a software engineer and learn something completely fresh and new.  
            The technology industry is becoming more important every year and software engineers are in high demand. 
            With the industry constantly evolving, it would be important to continue my education and seek out and learn about new tools, new programming languages, or learn about improvements to older programs.
            I also like to problem solve, and that would come in handy if I needed to dig into large complex codes and identify issues.  
            This opportunity to learn a career-based skill in such a short and intensive timeframe sounds challenging and I like a good challenge and I know I can be successful in that kind of environment.
